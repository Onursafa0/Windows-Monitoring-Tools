# ðŸ”‘ Registry Activity Monitor

A Windows C++ program that monitors changes in the registry key:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software` and logs detected changes to a text file.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Monitors the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software` key.
- Logs:
  - Key name changes
  - Attribute changes
  - Last set time updates
  - Security changes
- Writes entries with timestamps to `registry_log.txt`.
- Throttles logging to avoid flooding (minimum 5-second interval).

---

## âš™ How It Works

1. Uses `RegNotifyChangeKeyValue` to watch for changes.
2. On change detection, logs the registry path and `"Change"` message.
3. Enforces a 5-second cooldown between logs.
4. Runs until manually stopped.
