# üìÑ Windows Monitoring Tools (C++)

A collection of **four standalone C++ Windows monitoring utilities**, each focusing on a different aspect of system activity.  
These tools are lightweight, use native Windows APIs, and log detected events to text files.

## üõ† Build Requirements
- Windows OS
- C++17 or later
- **Compiler:** MinGW or MSVC
- **Libraries:**
  - `user32` (for Directory Monitor)
  - `ws2_32` & `iphlpapi` (for Network Monitor)
  - `Advapi32` (for Registry Monitor)

---

## üìÑ Build Instructions
Each tool has its own `README.md` inside its folder with specific build commands.  

**Example using MinGW:**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o directory_monitor directory_monitor.cpp -luser32
```
## ‚ñ∂ Usage
Each application runs as a standalone executable.
Run from the command line:

**Directory Monitor**
```bash
directory_monitor.exe "C:\Path\To\Monitor"
```

**Network Monitor**
```bash
network_monitor.exe
```

**Process Monitor**
```bash
process_monitor.exe
```

**Registry Monitor**
```bash
registry_monitor.exe
```

## ‚ö† Notes
- All tools run until manually stopped (usually `Ctrl + C`).

- Logs are saved in the same folder as the executable.

- Administrator rights may be required for some monitoring tasks.
